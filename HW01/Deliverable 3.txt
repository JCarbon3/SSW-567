I did not encounter any challenges during this assignment.

The requirements for this assignment are relatively simple, but it is important to think about the order they are implemented in, or else some situations may provide incorrect results.

I did not encounter any challenges with the tools.

When determining the test cases, I wanted to make sure I had test cases that would return all unique results, and if they met the requirements of multiple, the most specific was returned.
